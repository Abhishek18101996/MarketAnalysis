# MarketAnalysis

The project analyzes the Bitcoin stock market data of the last ten years to identify patterns and trends. The project involves loading and preprocessing the data, which includes handling missing values, resampling the data, and calculating various technical indicators such as Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI). The project then uses different visualization techniques to identify trends and patterns, such as plotting candlestick charts, moving averages, and volume analysis. The final part of the project involves creating a trading strategy based on the identified patterns and trends, which is backtested on the historical data to evaluate its performance.
